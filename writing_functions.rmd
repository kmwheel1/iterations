```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

set.seed(1)
```

We're going to write some functions. 

```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = .3)

(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)
```

Already getting complicated and getting a z score is one of the easiest things you can do.  Can write a function to simplify. 

```{r}
z_scores = function(x_arg) {
  ##adding conditional formatting so the function only works on the type of data you want
    if (!is.numeric(x_arg)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x_arg) == 1) {
    stop("Z scores cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  z = (x_arg - mean(x_arg)) / sd(x_arg)
  z
  
}

z_scores(x)
```

try out the function
```{r, error = TRUE}
z_scores(x_arg = y)
##figure out what y is after class

z_scores(x = 3)
#does not work
z_scores("my name is jeff")
#does not work
z_scores(x = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
#does work
z_scores(x = iris)
#does not work
```

## Multiple Outputs
```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(input_x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x_arg)) {
    stop("Argument x should be numeric")
  } else if (length(x_arg) == 1) {
    stop("Cannot be computed for length 1 vectors")
  }
  
  tibble(
  mean_input = mean(input_x),
  sd_x = sd(input_x)
  )

  list(
    mean_input = mean(input_x), 
       sd_input = sd(input_x),
       z_score = (input_x - mean(input_x))/(sd(input_x))
  )
}
```

test the function above
```{r}

```
